                        Hey everyone, <br><br>

                        What a year 2023 has been for us! From getting engaged and married then moving from Maryland to
                        sunny California, every moment has been an adventure. But the best news!?!? We're expecting our
                        first
                        child, Josiah Carl Conteh (name pending), in February 2024!<br><br>

                        Our Journey: It started with a beautiful proposal in Panama and a heartfelt wedding back home in
                        the DMV
                        "DC, Maryland, Virgina", followed by a big move across the country. Each step has brought us
                        closer
                        together and made our story even more special.<br><br>

                        Preparing for Josiah: As we eagerly await Josiah's arrival, we're getting everything ready for
                        him. We'd
                        love your support and involvement in this exciting time. To help us prepare, please check out
                        our baby
                        registry linked below.<br><br>
